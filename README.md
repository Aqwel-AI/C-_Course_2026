# C++ Course: From Absolute Beginner to Advanced Systems

Welcome to a complete, book-length, project-based C++ course that starts from zero and ends at systems-level topics. The course is designed for students, olympiad / competitive programmers, game developers, and backend engineers who want a deep, practical understanding of modern C++ (C++17/C++20).

This repository is structured like a curriculum, not a single tutorial. Each chapter is a standalone learning unit with clear goals, long-form explanations, practical examples, common mistakes, homework, and a mini-project where applicable.

## What this course covers
- Fundamentals: syntax, variables, data types, input/output, and comments
- Control flow: branching, loops, and structured program logic
- Core language: functions, arrays, strings, pointers, references, memory management
- OOP and design: classes, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Templates and STL: generic programming, containers, iterators, algorithms
- Algorithms and data structures: sorting, searching, trees, graphs, hash tables
- Practical development: debugging, CMake, Git, file I/O, exceptions
- Modern C++: RAII, smart pointers, move semantics, `auto`, `constexpr`
- Systems topics: multithreading, performance, cache behavior, undefined behavior
- Applied tracks: game dev basics, backend/systems, competitive programming
- Projects: calculator, todo app, file-based database, simple game, mini engine, capstone

## Who this course is for
- Beginners who have never coded in C++ and want a structured path
- Students preparing for exams, interviews, or programming contests
- Developers switching to C++ for performance or systems programming
- Game developers learning engine-level concepts

## Repository structure
The course follows a numbered chapter system:
- `00-introduction` through `21-projects` contain the main lessons
- `homeworks/` contains 5–10 exercises per chapter (no solutions here)
- `quizzes/` provides short knowledge checks
- `final-project/` contains the capstone requirements

## How to use this repo
1. Start at `00-introduction` and follow chapters in order.
2. Read the **📖 READ** section first to build conceptual understanding.
3. Study the theory, then review the code examples.
4. Solve homework for practice and retention.
5. Build mini-projects to integrate multiple topics.
6. Use quizzes to check your understanding.

If you are already experienced, you can jump to specific chapters, but the course is designed to be sequential.

## Suggested pacing
- **Beginner pace**: 2–3 chapters per week (8–12 weeks total)
- **Intermediate pace**: 1 chapter per week with deeper projects
- **Intensive pace**: 1 chapter per day (review on weekends)

## Prerequisites
No prior C++ knowledge is required. Basic comfort with using a computer and file system is enough. If you have programming experience in another language, you can move faster through the early chapters.

## Contribution rules
- Issues and pull requests are welcome.
- Keep explanations beginner-friendly and add examples when possible.
- Do not add solutions to homework in the main branch.
- Maintain consistent style and formatting with existing chapters.
