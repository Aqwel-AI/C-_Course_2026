# Homework 01: Setup and Tools

1. Install a compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC) and verify it in the terminal.
2. Compile a single file with `-std=c++17` and run the executable.
3. Create a basic `CMakeLists.txt` for a Hello World program.
4. Create a `.gitignore` file and explain why it is needed.
5. Initialize a Git repo, make a commit, and push to GitHub.
6. Use a debugger to step through a program with a loop.
7. Bonus: Compare GCC vs Clang error messages for the same bug.
